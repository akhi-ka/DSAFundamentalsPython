# Queue Data Structure

## Introduction
This project focuses on the Queue data structure, an essential collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Queues are widely used in computer science for managing processes, handling asynchronous data, and in various algorithms.

## Core Concepts
- **FIFO Principle:** The first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.
- **Enqueue Operation:** Adding an element to the rear of the queue.
- **Dequeue Operation:** Removing an element from the front of the queue.
- **Front and Rear:** The first and last elements of a queue, respectively.
- **Circular Queue:** A queue in which the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle, optimizing storage capacity.

## Implementing a Queue in Python
```python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop(0)

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[0]

    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)
```

## Applications of Queue
- Managing requests on a single shared resource (like a printer).
- Handling asynchronous data (like IO Buffers).
- Implementing breadth-first search in graphs.

## Challenges and Exercises
- Implement a circular queue.
- Create a priority queue where elements are removed based on priority rather than order.
- Develop a simulation using a queue (like a supermarket checkout system).

We welcome contributions to enhance this project, including the addition of new features, optimizations, or documentation improvements.
