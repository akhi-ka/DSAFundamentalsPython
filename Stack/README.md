# Stack Data Structure

## Introduction
This project focuses on the Stack data structure, a collection of elements with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element. Stacks are known for their Last In, First Out (LIFO) behavior, making them useful in various applications like undo mechanisms, parsing, and algorithmic problem solving.

## Core Concepts
- **LIFO Principle:** The last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.
- **Push Operation:** Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop Operation:** Removes the element on the top of the stack.
- **Peek Operation:** Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
- **Underflow and Overflow:** Conditions in which a stack is empty (underflow) or full (overflow).

## Implementing a Stack in Python
```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[-1]

    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)
```

## Applications of Stack
- Reversing data.
- Syntax Parsing in compilers.
- Maintaining function calls (call stack).
- Backtracking problems (like maze solving, puzzle games).

## Challenges and Exercises
- Implement a stack using a linked list.
- Add a function to get the minimum element from the stack in O(1) time.
- Create an algorithm to evaluate a postfix expression using a stack.
